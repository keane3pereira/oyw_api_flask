# oyw_api_flask
__Orlem Youth Week 2019.__ This project made it so much more fun! Also, the first _real_ project I was part of, ended up being an amazing experience!:sparkles::sparkles:

We created an E-Ticketing software... consisting of 3 components:
1. Registration website (React)
2. A Scanning App (Flutter)
3. This repository contains the backend for both, written in Flask.

Check out the code for the Ticket Scanner App!! https://github.com/sansqra/oywscanner.
