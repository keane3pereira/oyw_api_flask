# oyw_api_flask
Orlem Youth Week 2019. This project made it so much more fun! Also the first 'real' project I was part of.

So, OYW decided to go paperless(partly), and so a new department was formed: Developers!
We created an E-Ticketing software... consisting of 2 components:
  1. Registration website, to be used by the Registration Department
  2. A Scanning App, to be used by Security, on customer entry.
  
This repository contains the backend for both.


If you want to check out the code for the Scanning app, visit https://github.com/sansqra/oywscanner
