# oyw_api_flask
Orlem Youth Week 2019. This project made it so much more fun! Also the first 'real' project I was part of, ended up being an amazing experience!

So, OYW decided to go paperless (partly), and so a new department was formed: Developers!
We created an E-Ticketing software... consisting of 3 components:
    1. Registration website (React)
    2. A Scanning App (Flutter)
  
This repository contains the backend for both, written in Flask.


If you want to check out the code for the Scanner App, visit https://github.com/sansqra/oywscanner.

Here's a few friends from the team:
