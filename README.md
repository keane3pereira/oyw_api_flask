# oyw_api_flask
__Orlem Youth Week 2019.__ This project made it so much more fun! Also the first _real_ project I was part of, ended up being an amazing experience!:star:

So, OYW decided to go paperless (partly), and so a new department was formed: Developers:exclamation::exclamation:
We created an E-Ticketing software... consisting of 3 components:
- Registration website (React)
- A Scanning App (Flutter)
- This repository contains the backend for both, written in Flask.


If you want to check out the code for the Scanner App, visit https://github.com/sansqra/oywscanner.
